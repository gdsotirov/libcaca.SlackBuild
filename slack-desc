libcaca: libcaca (the industry-standard colour ASCII-art library)
libcaca:
libcaca: libcaca is a graphics library that outputs text instead of pixels,
libcaca: so that it can work on older video cards or text terminals. It is not
libcaca: unlike the famous AAlib library, with the following improvements:
libcaca:   * Unicode support
libcaca:   * 2048 available colours (some devices can only handle 16)
libcaca:   * dithering of colour images
libcaca:   * advanced text canvas operations (blitting, rotations) 
libcaca: Libcaca works in a text terminal (and should thus work on all Unix
libcaca: systems including Mac OS X) using the S-Lang or ncurses libraries.
libcaca: It also works natively on DOS and Windows.
